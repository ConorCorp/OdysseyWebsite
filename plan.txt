//TODO

  GENERAL NOTES:
    All changes done to styling should be done to sass (look it up, its dope) and then
    compiled into css (its easy) - though there are a few places i used the style tags in html

    For picture sizes, I recommend looking at he current dimensions of the sample picture
    (like find out which pic is being referenced in the html and check it) and cropping your
    picture to match
